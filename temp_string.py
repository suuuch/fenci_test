報章報導，http://www.baidu.com中學教學語言政策正醞釀巨大而重要
的改變，學校在選擇教學語言上，或者會有更多
自決空間。不過，孫明揚同時指出，校本自決教
學語言必須有所規管，避免重蹈 1998 年實施母
語教學前，學校宣揚教學語言名不副實「掛羊頭賣
狗肉」，或中英混雜語教學等「無王管」情况。

我沒有做過關於教學語言方面的研究，但從個人
經驗所得，「中英混雜語教學」是一種很優秀的教
學模式。我所就讀的中學，就是孫公提到「掛羊頭
賣狗肉」那種。從初中開始，除了中文和中史科之
外的教本都是用英文，寫報告、考試也是用英文，
上課講的聽的卻是中文，因為這樣能較好地理解
和討論。上大學後，一下子到了全英語學習環境，
我沒有遇到困難。我懂得用英文來寫技術文章，懂得
讀英文的教科書，也會用英語跟教授們溝通。



反過來說，我們並不是生活在英語社會，所以日常英
語對我們而言，並沒有太多應用上的意義。當然這不是
說英文課沒有用，因為常用的英文生字，基礎文法等等
還是要學，這些在各個範疇都適用。但若以實際所需來說，
則技術英語和商業英語，才是我們香港人的日常英語。即使
我不知道餐牌上的那堆字，即使我不懂用地道的英語跟洋人
溝通，我仍然可以生活得很好。要去旅行時怎辦？到時再學好
了，事實證明那並不困難。始終我讀教科書的時間比讀餐牌的
時間多，重點應該放在這方面。
US President-elect Donald Trump has asserted he
won the popular vote on 8 November "if you deduct
 the millions of people who voted illegally".
The Republican, who won the all-important electoral
college count, offered no evidence to back his claim.
It comes after the camp of Democratic rival Hillary
Clinton said it would support a vote recount in Wisconsin initiated by a Green Party candidate.
Mrs Clinton won about two million votes more than Mr
 Trump in the popular vote.
However, Mr Trump surpassed the required 270 electoral
votes to win the presidency. This was based on the state-by-state contests.

學習文法亦然。單單懂得語法規則，不能令我們懂得用英文
寫作。當年所學的那些規則，我從來沒有放在心上，但我還
是能夠寫出流暢的英文文章。中學七年接觸英文的閱讀材料，
寫報告、做功課也是用英文，長時間潛移默化，語法規則自
然就懂，讀寫都不是問題。

反觀我現在工作上接觸到的大專生，大都是母語教育培養
出來的。他們有的連 “approximate" 、"evaluate" 這些
字都不懂，而且不是個別現象。如果中學用英文教本，會出現
這種情況嗎？這究竟是學生的錯，還是教育政策的錯？

In his follow-up tweets, the Republican wrote: "It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than in the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 states instead of the 15 states that I visited."
"I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!"
Mr Trump also alleged "serious voter fraud" in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - states won by Mrs Clinton - accusing US media of not reporting on that issue.
Earlier on Sunday, the president-elect reminded his Democratic rival that she had already admitted defeat, and published remarks from the presidential debates in which she had urged an acceptance of the poll results.
At the time, Mrs Clinton was reacting to Mr Trump's refusal to respect the outcome.

初中學生讀不通英文教本，解決方法應該是讓
老師採用「中英混雜語教學」，讓學生慢慢適應，而不是乾脆換成中文教本
，把問題推遲七年，讓學生要上大專的時候，才發現自己仍是讀不通，而要苦苦尋求
提升語言能力的大力菜。英語教學令學生容易適應大專學習，母語教學幫助學生明白課程內容；「中英混
雜語教學」兼兩者之長，應該是最好的教學模式。決策者對於「中英混雜語教學」的排斥，不知是
否擔心學生日常說話也「中英混雜」，甚或只是源於對某種完美主義的堅持。相比於整個中學
階段的學習成果而言，這些都是容易解決的小事。各種考慮孰輕孰重，教育界要懂得衡量，不要
再浪費了學子們的寶貴光陰。


Hillary Clinton has admitted defeat in the 8 November presidential elections
Mr Trump narrowly beat the Democratic candidate in Wisconsin, where a recount of the votes was initiated last week by Green Party candidate Jill Stein.
Dr Stein also wants recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania, citing "statistical anomalies".
The Green Party nominee reportedly wants to be sure computer hackers did not skew the poll in favour of Mr Trump.
Concerns over possible Russian interference had been expressed in the run-up to the vote.
The US government has said Russian state actors were behind hacks on the Democratic National Committee, a claim denied by Moscow.
Results would need to be overturned in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania to alter the outcome of the November presidential election - something analysts say is highly unlikely.
Mrs Clinton's campaign has said it will participate in Wisconsin's recount.
Her campaign's general counsel, Marc Elias, said there was no evidence to conclude the election had been sabotaged, but "we have an obligation to the more than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton to participate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will be reported".

我認為對我的英文能力助力最大的，不是中學的英
文課程，而是那些用英文寫成的數理科教本。我在
中學的英文課程裡學了很多生字，當中大多是日常
英語 (daily English) 方面的，例如是我們在餐
牌上所見到的那堆字。但現實是，我們從英文課裡學
到的字，只有在其它科目裡見過用過，才會容易記著。
而且大學課程和日常工作裡所需要的英文生字，並不
只是中學所教的日常用字，還有更多是技術英語 (technical English)
和商業英語 (business English)。這些字要從哪裡學來呢？
自然是其它科目的教本。
